## Motivation

With midterms coming up over the next few weeks, we want to be able to keep track of all the homework assignments weâ€™ve completed, exams we have to study for, and more. We will be creating a to-do list web application that implements Google Firebase technologies to help you stay organized.

## Features

- Uses Cloud Firestore to store to do list items
- Uses JavaScript to connect to Cloud Firestore and render to-do list items in HTML front-end
- Ability to add or remove items from the to-do list on the HTML front-end

## Important Note

After you add or remove a task from your to-do list, refresh the page if you want to see the action's result on the client-side.

## How to Run

If you're using Visual Studio Code as your IDE of choice, use the Live Server extenstion so you can start-up a server in order to test the connections to and from
Firebase.
